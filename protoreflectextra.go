// Package protoreflectextra provides extra types and wrappers to make the "google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect" package usage even easier.
//
// Main areas of fucus are around enums, lists (repeated fields) and maps to make operating those types more similar to operating messages. And to do this without replacing the "google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect" package but rather by expanding it.
